# SoccerApplication2
<h2 style="font-size:40px">Description</h2>
<p>Project was influenced by my love for soccer,JavaScript and I wanted to get better at using API’s , so what’s better than combining the two!

I used 2 api's, one was the (Football-api), and the other was called (API-Football).
The reason I used 2 was because the API-Football had a ton more data and it was faster but it had a lower limit when it came to the amount of api calls the user could use per day, so I used 2 different ones to be able to use the app more.

<h2 style="font-size:40px">Aim for this project:</h2>
<p>The primary aim of this project is to provide an intuitive web application that allows soccer fans to stay up to date with their favorite teams and leagues. By integrating two powerful APIs, I aim to deliver the latest news and league standings across the MLS, Prem, La Liga, and Bundesliga directly to the user's fingertips.
But beyond that, this project is also an opportunity for me to improve my skills in JavaScript and API usage. By tackling the challenges of integrating and managing multiple APIs, I've gained valuable experience in handling data in real-time and developing responsive web applications.
I believe that the skills I've acquired while working on this project will help me take on even more ambitious projects in the future. Ultimately, my goal is to create innovative solutions that provide real value to users, and I'm confident that this project is an important step in that direction.
